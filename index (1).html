    <marquee width="100%" direction="down" height="700px">“There are two types of education- one that teaches you how to make a living and the other that teaches you how to live.”

The agenda of education at Xavier’s is to focus more on formation of the youth rather than just imparting knowledge. In a world that is getting more and more bankrupt on basic human values Xaverians are trained to become better human beings. The school inculcates the qualities of a passion for excellence, desire for freedom, courage, confidence, spirit of inquisitiveness etc. in its students.

Education at Xavier’s transcends the boundaries of the classrooms. The four walls of the classroom and what happens therein do not define education. The teachers as well as students are infused with a rare passion much like that of our patron saint and founder – St. Francis Xavier and Ignatius of Loyola. Without being overtly spoken about, these great saints have found their way into the life blood of every Xaverian student and teacher alike.

WE AIM :

to develop in the student an attitude of openness to growth and enable him to begin to take responsibility for his own growth.
to prepare the student to be intellectually competent: to promote the development of the intellectual skills, understanding, and mastery of the academic requirements necessary for advanced forms of education and for life.
to help the student to become mature religiously: to help him to know the major doctrines and practices of the Catholic Church and to learn to examine critically his own religious feelings and beliefs.
to help the student to become a loving person: to assist him in the establishment of his own identity and in his movement beyond self-centeredness toward more significant relationships with others.
to foster in the student a commitment to doing justice: to help him develop as a person for others and to prepare him to take his place as a competent , concerned, and responsible member of society.</marquee>

            <marquee width="100%" direction="down" height="700px">St. Xavier’s Senior Secondary School, Delhi-54 is a Christian minority school established by the Society of Jesus in 1960. The School is recognized by the Directorate of Education, Delhi Administration and is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education.

The School Management
St. Xavier’s School is run by the Society of Jesus, an international Christian religious order that follows the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, founded by Ignatius of Loyola in 1540. The members of the Society are popularly known as the Jesuits. The Society is headquartered in Rome. The Jesuits are primarily known for their work in education (like founding schools, colleges, universities and seminaries), intellectual research, and cultural pursuits, and for their missionary efforts in human rights and social justice. They are one of the largest educational bodies in the world. From their humble beginning in Europe in 1540 they have etched their presence in 112 nations on six continents. Today perhaps the best known education in India has been imparted by the Jesuits. More than 250,000 students belonging to every religious, linguistic and socio-economic group receive their education in the Jesuit educational institutions all across the country.

Xavier’s – A True Catholic School:
St. Xavier’s is a Christian minority school. It not only gives preferential admission to the Christian/Catholic students but also makes a constant and sincere effort to inculcate Christian ethos and a secular outlook in its students. While all the students are provided with regular value education, special attention is provided to the Christian/Catholic students in imparting Catechism classes. Scripture reading is encouraged among the students and the students recite the Lord’s Prayer with devotion. Christian devotional songs are sung at the morning assembly and Holy Mass is celebrated specially for the Catholic students on all first Fridays of the month and on Feast days. All these help in faith formation of the Catholic students. Without exception all Xaverians imbibe the Gospel values while at school and become agents of social changes in their later life.

Our Clientele:
Though St. Xavier’s, Delhi was started as a residential school in 1960, today it has become a true neighborhood school, educating 4383 students (2737 boys and 1646 girls) from the Prep Department to Class 12. Each class has six sections, each section having an average number of 52-56 students.

Our Staff:
At present the school has 137 staff in all the three departments- the Senior, the Junior and the Prep. Out of the 137 staff members 107 are ladies and 30 gents. A true Maternal school! Milestones in the history of Xavier’s

Hotel Cecil complex, a Boys’ only Boarding school, an Exclusive School for the Elite class, Introduction of Co-education, the School becoming Socially Inclusive, Change of the Medium of Teaching, Drastic upgradation of the School’s infrastructure at the beginning of the New Millennium, a modern technology driven school – these are some of the landmarks on the fifty five year journey of our school.

From Hotel Cecil to Xavier’s, Delhi:

The present St. Xavier’s School campus used to be a British Five Star hotel named Hotel Cecil, one of the three oldest and most famous and popular British Five Star Hotels of Delhi in 1950’s. It was started in 1904 by Mrs. F.E. Hotz, mother of the American siblings Mr. Hans Hotz (the then Managing Director of the Hotz Hotels in India) and his sister Ms. White. In the post independent Delhi, Hotel Cecil was known for its homely environment. It had large apartment like suites, which made it a favourite of many European families that visited India in those days.

In 1950’s Hotel Cecil was known as the 'Country Club' because there were hosts of beautiful flowers all over the hotel complex. It was “quite popular among the British women who would often come here for idle gossip in the afternoons and would return in the evenings with their husbands for dinner and dance.” (As reported by the Hindustan Times dated August 31, 2011). The lawns were well manicured and the Neem trees looked absolutely majestic. There were numerous shady trees and a variety of flowers like Rose and Dahlia on the campus.

By 1958 the Management of Hotel Cecil ran into labour troubles and they decided to sell the property to someone who would look after the campus and not commercialize it. Coincidently in 1958 Patna Jesuit Vice-Provincial Fr. Edward F. Mann, S.J. appointed Fr. Frank Loesch, S.J. to look for a suitable site to begin a school in Delhi. The then Archbishop of Delhi Rev. Joseph Fernandes was more than happy to invite the Jesuits to Delhi.

It was Fr. James Tong S.J. (the Kentucky born Jesuit who was the chaplain of the Catholic Hospital Association of India and had been working in Delhi for a long time) who discovered that the Cecil Hotel was up for sale. The Hotel came up for the consideration of the Jesuits as a possible site for the new school in Delhi. This location was more suitable for their purposes and the Archbishop and the Apostolic Internuncio were very much enthusiastic about the Jesuits purchasing it. Fr. James Tong S.J. then initiated the negotiations between the Patna Jesuit Society and the Cecil Hotel Management for the transaction of the property. In June 1959 Fr. Loesch began discussions with the Cecil owners. Finally, on 1st November, 1959 the Cecil Hotel ceased to function and the property was transferred to Delhi St. Xavier’s Society on 21st December, 1959. St. Xavier’s, Delhi was blessed and inaugurated on 6th January, 1960 by the most Rev. James R. Knox, the Apostolic Internuncio in India.

Boy’s Only Boarding School
With his architectural competence Fr. Loesch, S.J., who was its first Rector, gave the Hotel building a new shape where the lives of many generations of students were to be destined. He got the hotel complex converted into a modern school and built the senior as well as junior school buildings by 1969. Initially Xavier’s was a boys’ only school and boarding facilities were provided to the students. By 1970’s it had become a school for Delhi’s elite class.

True Neighbourhood School:
In 1971 the boarding facilities were closed down to provide educational facilities to a large number of students from Delhi. Gradually it became a true neighbourhood school. The objective of introducing neighbourhood policy was to help the students to use the school facilities even after school time or on holidays. The parents too found it easy to come to school and meet the teachers of their wards.

From Elitist to an Inclusive School:
With their General Chapter of 1974, the Jesuits developed sharper awareness towards the structural dimensions of injustice in the human society and committed themselves to do what they could, to create a just and humane society. It became the policy of the school to create an egalitarian society by providing quality education to all strata of the society. This includes those without economic means, the handicapped, the marginalised and all those who are, in any sense, unable to live a life of full human dignity. In Jesuit education this option is reflected both in the students that are admitted and in the type of formation that is given.

                From 1980 Xavier’s gave up its elitist culture of being an exclusive school and decided to be an inclusive school where preferential admission was given to the children from the socio-economically weaker sections of the society. Nearly 25% of the students are now from the poor families in the neighbourhood who cannot otherwise afford quality education.</marquee></section>

        <br>
     <marquee width="100%" direction="down" height="700px">In the context of the unequal socio-economic conditions in our country, and in the light of an evaluation of the educational mission of the Society of Jesus all over the world by its own members, a policy orientation has been introduced at St. Xavier's School since 1978-79. The following are some of the features of these changes:


1.The Clientele:

In a true spirit of democracy and fair deal and in order to discourage the possible culture of affluence and the image of elitism in the school, preferential admission will be given to the economically and socially weaker sections of the society who can profit from our education. Already since 1978, 20% of the fresh admissions in the Prep Class have been reserved for students from the disadvantaged sections of the society. Gradually we hope to increase this percentage with the co-operation and help of the parents of our students. At the same time the school will continue to exercise its special responsibility for the education of Christians.


2.A Neighbourhood School:

The school which was started as a predominantly boarding school in the old British hotel building, closed down its boarding facilities by 1972 to provide educational facilities to a large number of students from Delhi. Thus it became a true neighbourhood school. The objective was to help the students to use the school facilities even after the school time or on holidays. The reason for becoming a neighbourhood school is not merely to make the school facilities more available to the students and to keep better contact with their families, but also to move towards making the school a Community School, open and responsive to the people of the neighbourhood, facilitating a two-way communication between the school and the home in a spirit of co-responsibility.


3.Education Relevant for a New India:

The ideals enshrined in the Constitution of India and the thrust envisaged for the new education policy of the Government of India fully coincide with the Jesuit concern for the poor and the underprivileged. What we aim at is an education that will integrate the various sections of the society by providing educational opportunities to the weaker sections, which is the biggest and the most effective single factor for egalitarianism. This small step will help, in its own measure, to move away from a dual-society that keeps the country divided between the established and the marginalized classes, the rich and the poor, those with power and influence and those that are powerless. Our aim is to give voice to the voiceless and power to the powerless.

         Increasing insistence will be laid on education and educational programmes aimed at this integration, cooperative effort among students and their sharing and growing together.Every student should bring the school diary daily. If a pupil loses the diary, he/she will be subjected to disciplinary action. A fine of Rs 50/- will be levied and a new diary will have to be purchased with necessary remarks about the loss of the previous one.
All students must be clean and neatly dressed in the school uniform according to the season. Trousers and blazers must be of the regulation pattern and colour. Baggy trousers are strictly prohibited (for uniformity and economy, deal only with our authorized tailor).
Black shoes with laces by boys, black shoes with buckles or laces by girls, are to be worn at all times. This specification is made with a view to ensure uniformity and prevent children pressurizing parents into avoidable expenses.
Indisciplined behaviour in the school bus will make the pupil ineligible to use school transportation. Bus monitors are assigned to help maintain discipline. Most buses also have teachers or other staff members. Obeying the instructions given by them (irregardless of the fact that they are your teachers or not) is a precondition to avail yourself of the school transport.
All school property must be taken care of and no student should scratch or spoil the desks or chairs or damage any other school furniture, write or draw anything on the walls or in any way damage things belonging to others. Damage done, even by accident, should be reported at once to the appropriate authority. Any damage done will be made good by the one who does it. If the culprit cannot be identified/ refuses to confess, the whole class will be liable to pay the penalty fixed by the concerned school authority. Anyone who sees something damaged should report the matter even if he/she does not know who has done it. Each class will be responsible for looking after all class property.
No books other than textbooks or library books may be brought to the school.
Pupils are forbidden to bring crackers, explosives and other dangerous material to school. Disciplinary action will be taken against such offenders.
Money should not be lent or borrowed, or articles exchanged.
Students are forbidden to bring mobile/cell phones to school.
Driving of vehicles to school by students is not allowed. In the event of them being caught doing so, the parent will be held responsible.
The school is not responsible for goods or money lost. Therefore it is not advisable to bring any valuables (like expensive watches or ornaments) to school.
Xaverians should behave in a courteous manner wherever they go. They should always remember that the school is judged by their conduct. They should greet teachers wherever they meet them.
The school reserves to itself the right to dismiss students whose diligence or progress in studies is steadily unsatisfactory or whose conduct is harmful to the other students or whose guardians show little interest in the progress of their wards. Immorality, grave insubordination, contempt of authority or willful damage to property is always a sufficient reason for immediate dismissal.
A student who uses unfair means and/or receives or gives assistance to other in any form during tests/exams will be given zero in that subject, and a warning letter. Repetition of the same will result in dismissal.
Parents and guardians may not visit their wards or their teachers in the classrooms.
N.B.Attention is called to the Delhi School Education Rule, No. 36, detailing forbidden practices which include smoking, use of drugs or intoxicants, rowdyism, rude behaviour, casteism and communalism. </marquee></section>
